- This project is used to record my reading notes of [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-00-common-programming-concepts.html)Chapter3 Common Programming Concepts.
- Thanks to this book again, I've learned a lot of basics about rust from this chapter.It's actually a sizable chapter!
- I've learned varibables, data types, functions, loops and flow control!
- I'm already known other languages such as C, Python, Java and so on, I'm gonna write things I've learned compare to these languages below.
- Mutable and Immutable variables in rust and constants, use "let" statement to declare a variable (default is immutable), use "let mut" for mutable and const for constants.
- Differs between statement and expression, expression returns a value and statement will not, so if you wanna return a value from a function use expression.
- Using "->" to indicate the return value type of a function, just like python's typing but rust's more strict because it's a staticly typed language.
- Using if, else and else if to do control flow things, but it doesn't need to use parentheses to wrap the condition(s) compare to c.
- "//" for comments just like c.
- Loops, labeled loop, while loop, and for loop.
- 0..10 just like python's range(0, 10) is a half open interval and you can use 1..=10 for a closed interval in rust.
One more thing, I'm using vim to write my rust code right now, I've learned the line editing of vim 
- use "ctrl+v" to get into visual mode
- "j" or "k" to move up or down for choosing the lines
- "shift+i" to get into insert mode 
- modify the first line
- press "esc" the magical thing will happen.
